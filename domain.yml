      Alice: We'll play a game called Alias to improve your vocabulary. I manage the game. Bob is your teacher and he plays with you.
      
      Alias basic rules:
      - player A explains the given word using descriptions, synonyms and antonyms, but it is forbidden to use the same root words
      - player B tries to guess the word that player A explains, and also asks leading questions
      
      Let me ask you a couple of questions and we'll get started!
